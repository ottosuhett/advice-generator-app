## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Generate a new piece of advice by clicking the dice icon

Note: Advice is cached for 2 seconds. Any repeat-request within 2 seconds will return the same piece of advice.
